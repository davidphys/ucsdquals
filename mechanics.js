{q:"Give a few methods to find the particular solution to the ODE $\\sum_n c_n \\frac{d^n}{dx^n} f(x)=g(x)$.",a:"One of the quickest methods is to guess and check: if $g$ is a polynomial of order $k$, then a particular solution of a polynomial of order $k$ will also work. If $g$ is a trig function with frequency $\\omega$, guessing a trig function of the same frequency generally works. For a second order problem, \"variation of parameters\" can be used, where you guess a solution $y_p=u_1 y_1+u_2 y_2$, where $y_1$ and $y_2$ are the solutions of the homogeneous problem and $u_1' y_1+u_2' y_2=0$ as a simplifying assumption. You can also always do a Fourier transform."},

To derive this, make the substitutions and consider $T(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\dot{q})-U(\\alpha q)=\\frac{\\alpha^2}{\\beta^2} T(\\dot{q})-\\alpha^k U(q)$.

We can rescale position by a factor of $\\alpha$ and time by a factor of $\\beta$ if and only if $\\alpha^{1-\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot (-1)}=\\beta$. So we see $\\beta=\\alpha^{3/2}$.

{q:"Write how to solve an action extremization problem $A[q]=\\int L(\\vec{q},\\dot{q},t) dt$ subject to $N$ holonomic constraints $f_i(\\vec{q})=0$.",a:"In this case, all you have to do is write the coordinates in terms of other coordinates such that the constraints are automatically satisfied.

{q:"Derive Noether's theorem for arbitrary transformations in space and time.",a:"This is finnicky, but Noether's theorem can be derived by considering the full effect of the boundary terms in the action functional. The general Noether's theorem is as follows: Suppose the mapping $q_i\\mapsto q_i+\\varepsilon f_i$ sends $L$ to $L+\\varepsilon\\frac{dK}{dt}$ for some function $K$. ie, that the infinitesimal transformation changes $L$ by a total time derivative. We know such a transformation doesn't change the equations of motion, so this is why such a $K$ is chosen. Calculating a variation in the action… first, we have by our assumption that the Lagrangian only varies by a total time derivative: $A[q_i+\\varepsilon f_i]-A[q_i]=\\varepsilon \\int dt \\frac{dK}{dt}=\\varepsilon K|^{t_2}_{t_1}$. Next, doing the Euler-Lagrange equation stuff and keeping boundary terms: $$A[q_i+\\varepsilon f_i]-A[q_i]=\\int dt\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial q_i}-\\frac{d}{dt}\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}_i}\\right) \\varepsilon f_i+\\varepsilon \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}_i} f_i \\bigg\\rvert^{t_2}_{t_1}$$ On shell ($q_i$ satisfying the equations of motion), the first term vanishes. Equating the boundary terms, we find $\\varepsilon\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}_i} f_i - K\\right)\\Big\\rvert^{t_2}_{t_1}=0$ for all $t_2$, hence $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}_i} f_i - K=\\text{const}$. For example, a translation in time can be represented by $f_i=\\dot{q}_i$ (since this maps $q_i\\mapsto q_i+\\varepsilon \\dot{q}_i$ and $\\dot{q}_i\\mapsto \\dot{q}_i+\\varepsilon \\ddot{q}_i$). But a translation in time just sends $L$ to $L+\\varepsilon \\frac{dL}{dt}$, so that $K=L$. Then the previous theorem tells us immediately that $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}_i} \\dot{q}_i-L$ is conserved."},
{q:"Derive conservation of momentum from Noether's theorem.",a:"Suppose $L=T-U$, where $T$ depends only on $\\dot{q}_i$ and $U$ depends only on the vectors $|q_i-q_j|$. Then if we send $\\vec{q}_i\\mapsto \\vec{q}_i+\\varepsilon \\hat{n}$, we have $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\varepsilon}=0$.

All magnitudes are changed by order $\\varepsilon^2$, so the Lagrangian is constant to first order. Then by Noether (omitting vector notation), $\\text{const}=(m_i \\dot{q}_i)\\cdot (\\omega\\times q_i)=\\omega \\times\\left(m_i q_i\\times \\dot{q}_i\\right)$, where the last equality follows from the vector triple product formula."},

Along the way it hits the $x=0$ line at position $y_w$. Then $A[q]=n_1\\sqrt{x_1^2+(y_1-y_w)^2}+n_2\\sqrt{x_2^2+(y_2-y_w)^2}$.

{q:"State and solve the Brachistochrone problem",a:"Statement: find the shape of a ramp such that it takes the least time for an object to move under gravity from position $(0,0)$ to $(x,y)$. The solution is the curve parameterized b y $x=A(\\theta-\\sin(\\theta))$, $y=A(1-\\cos(\\theta))$. To prove this, we'll write a functional of $x(\\theta)$ and $y(\\theta)$ that gives the time taken $T[x,y]$. The arc length is $ds=d\\theta\\sqrt{x'^2+y'^2}$ and the velocity is $\\frac{1}{2}m v^2=mgy$, hence $v=\\sqrt{2gy}$. So $T[x,y]=\\int d\\theta \\sqrt{x'^2+y'^2}/\\sqrt{2gy}$. The equation that the cyclic coordinate x is conserved is enough to solve this problem. $k=\\partial L/\\partial x'=\\frac{x'}{\\sqrt{2gy}\\sqrt{x'^2+y'^2}}$. Inverting, $x'^2=\\frac{2gyk^2y'^2}{1-2gyk^2}$, allowing us to relate $dx$ to $dy$. Set $2gk^2=A$.

{q:"Prove that shallow water waves ($\\omega=k\\sqrt{gh}$) arrive parallel to the shore.",a:"We have the wave group velocity $v=\\sqrt{gh}$, so by the Fermat principle we minimize $\\int ds/\\sqrt{gh}$. If this is a path $y(x)$ and the height is a function $h(x)$, then we minimize $A[y]=\\int dx \\sqrt{\\frac{1+y'^2}{gh}}$.

{q:"Prove that the Lagrangian for a free particle must be a constant times $x'(t)^2$.",a:"Time translation invariance tells us $L$ does not depend on $t$. Translation invariance tells us $L$ cannot depend on $x$. Rotation invariance tells us $L$ can only depend on the magnitude $\\dot{x}^2$. Invariance under galilean boosts is different, it tells us that $L$ can only change by a total time derivative under a boost. Then suppose $L=f(v^2)$. Under a galilean boost, $f((v+\\varepsilon)^2)=f(v^2)+f'(v^2)2\\varepsilon\\cdot v$. For the term on the right to be a total time derivative, it must be proportional to $v$, hence $f'=c$.

Proof: From $\\dot{r}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\mu}(E-U_{eff})}$ and $\\dot{\\theta}=\\frac{\\ell}{\\mu r^2}$, we have $$\\theta=\\int_{r_0}^{r_f} \\frac{\\ell dr}{r^2\\sqrt{2\\mu(E+K/r-\\ell^2/(2\\mu r^2))}}$$ Make the substitution $u=1/r$ to get $$\\theta=-\\int_{r_0}^{r_f} du\\left(\\frac{2\\mu E}{\\ell^2}+\\frac{2\\mu k}{\\ell^2}u-u^2\\right)^{-1/2}$$ Complete the square in the denominator: put $B=\\frac{\\mu k}{\\ell^2}$ and $A=\\frac{2\\mu E}{\\ell^2}$ to get a denominator $-(u-B)^2+B^2+A$.

Soln: We know $r(\\theta)=\\frac{p}{1+e\\cos(\\theta)}$.

The apoapsis is the point of furthest reach (in this case $r(\\pi)$). The periapsis is the point of closest approach (in this case $r(0)$).
